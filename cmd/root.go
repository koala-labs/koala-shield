	Short: "A command line tool to quickly research, identify, and block malicious IPs",
	Long: `Koala Shield is a command line tool for tracing an IP address 
to it's Autonomous System Number (ASN) and then quickly blocking all 
requests originating from a malicious actor by using AWS WAF.
	
Examples:

	koala-shield lookup 8.6.8.0 --> find information about the IP address

	koala-shield block 20473 --> block the ASN 20473 using AWS WAF

Be careful when blocking an entire ASN! Make sure the ASN owner is never 
a commercial or residential ISP!`,
